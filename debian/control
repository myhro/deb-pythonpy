Description: 'python -c', with tab completion and shorthand
 pythonpy is an utility that facilitates the usage of Python one-liners. The
 command 'py' evaluates a string consisting of any Python expression. It can do
 anything from simple arithmetic to complex operations, importing modules
 automatically. It also comes with tab completion.
 .
 Its usage is not restricted to single expressions only. There's also the
 possiblity to pipe data from stdin and to stdout, even generating strings to
 be evaluated by other programs.
